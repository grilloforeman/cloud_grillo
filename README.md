# Cloud Grillo 🦗

Cloud Grillo is a basic cloud platform developed using **SOLID principles**, **PHP**, and the **MVC architecture**.  
It delivers a lightweight cloud environment that provides a terminal accessible via **SSH**, similar to an **AWS EC2** instance or **OpenStack**.  

The project is also an analogy to **phpMyAdmin**, but designed for a single user. Its architecture can be extended to support 
multiple users, making it a **free cloud solution** for broader use cases.
